Congratulations on the first day of the rest of your life. Hold onto your pants cuz your mind is about to be blown 


## Programs

This is where you write your programs and test. This gets compiled to wasm and the result is meant to be posted on-chain

## Generate Types

Types are meant top be posted with the program, it is how people know how to interact with your program 

```cargo run generate-types``` 

Will generate two files that will hold both the aux_data_schema and config_schema
